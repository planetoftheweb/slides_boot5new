# Stacks

- `v-stack`, `h-stack`
- `gap-*`, `margin` utils
- `.vr` for vertical rules

There's two types of stacks, vertical and horizontal.

The `v-stack` creates elements that are full width by default, but you can use utilities like margin and gap in order to control how they look.

`hstack` is for horizontal layouts and you can use margin utilities to control their spacing.

There's also a really nice utility called `vr` that is just like a horizontal rule, but meant for quick vertical lines.
