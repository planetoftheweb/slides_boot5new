# Aspect Ratios

`ratio`

- `ratio-{VAL}`
  - VAL: `1x1` `4x3` `16x9` `21x9`

The responsive embed helpers have been renamed to ratio helpers with some new class names. Instead of the word by, you use an x. There used to be a class called `embed-responsive-class` which is gone.

There are some aspect ratio classes to help with setting the proportions of elements. These are designed to go in a container class that wraps elements like `<iframe>` `<embed>` `<video>`
`<object>` but will work with other elements like `<div>` or `<img>`.

# Visually Hidden

- Removed: `sr-only` `sr-only-focusable`
- `visually-hidden` `visually-hidden-focusable`

> >

There were two clases called sr-only and sr-only-focusable that have been removed.

Instead, there is a new class called `visually-hidden` that hides elements, but shows them to screen readers.

`visually-hidden-focusable` - is another version that does the same thing, but shows the elements when they're focusable.
