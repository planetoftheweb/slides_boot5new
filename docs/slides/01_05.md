Some of the changes affect how Bootstrap Utilities work, let's take a look.

Where an element sits is relative to a position attribute and we have four sides with three position options we can specify.

There's also an extra property you can use to center elements in each of the corners.

# Border Width

- `border-{NUM}`
  - NUM: `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`

There are some border width utilities for for borders from 1 to 5 pixels. By the way, `border-1` happens to be the same size as just border. You can also combine these with the contextual colors or sizes, but they will affect all of the borders in the current element.

# Radius Sizes

- Removed `rounded-sm` `rounded-lg`
- `rounded-{NUM}`
  - NUM: `0` `1` `2` `3`

<a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/YzNxoKz?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

A couple of classes were removed for border radius sizes.

If you want a little better control over the roundness of the edges you can use these sizes right here. `rounded-0` is the same as not adding `rounded`, `rounded-1` is slightly smaller roundness than just using the `rounded` class and `rounded-3` is slightly bigger.

# Gap

- `d-grid`
- `gap-{AMT}`

`0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`

There's a small addition to the list of display properties called d-grid. It allows you to build simple grids quickly.

There's an additional utility called gap that is only relevant to classes like the `display-grid` class.
